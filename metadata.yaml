description: "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding is a book by the Scottish\
  \ empiricist philosopher David Hume, published in English in 1748. It was a revision\
  \ of an earlier effort, Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature, published anonymously\
  \ in London in 1739â€“40. Hume was disappointed with the reception of the Treatise,\
  \ which \"fell dead-born from the press,\" as he put it, and so tried again to disseminate\
  \ his more developed ideas to the public by writing a shorter and more polemical\
  \ work.\nThe end product of his labours was the Enquiry. The Enquiry dispensed with\
  \ much of the material from the Treatise, in favor of clarifying and emphasizing\
  \ its most important aspects. For example, Hume's views on personal identity do\
  \ not appear. However, more vital propositions, such as Hume's argument for the\
  \ role of habit in a theory of knowledge, are retained.\nThis book has proven highly\
  \ influential, both in the years that would immediately follow and today. Immanuel\
  \ Kant points to it as the book which woke him from his self-described \"dogmatic\
  \ slumber\". The Enquiry is widely regarded as a classic in modern philosophical\
  \ literature.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
